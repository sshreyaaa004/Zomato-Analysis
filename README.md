# 🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis and Restaurant Rating Prediction

A comprehensive data science project that explores Zomato’s restaurant dataset to uncover insights into customer preferences, restaurant types, cost trends, and voting patterns through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize the Zomato restaurant dataset using Python. Through EDA techniques and data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, we derive insights about restaurant behavior, pricing strategies, and user engagement.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: Zomato Open Dataset (CSV)
- **Attributes**:
  - `name` – Restaurant name
  - `online_order` – Availability of online ordering (Yes/No)
  - `book_table` – Table booking availability (Yes/No)
  - `rate` – Average rating
  - `votes` – Number of customer votes
  - `approx_cost(for two people)` – Estimated cost for two
  - `listed_in(type)` – Type/category (Café, Quick Bites, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy` – Data handling
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – Data visualization
  - `TextBlob` (optional) – Sentiment analysis

---

## 🔍 Analysis Process

1. **Data Import & Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies
   - Explored data distributions and relationships

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Restaurant count by type
   - Top 10 restaurants by votes
   - Average cost analysis by restaurant type

3. **Code Optimization**
   - Fixed Seaborn palette warnings
   - Applied `tight_layout()` for clean plots

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Popular Restaurant Types**: "Quick Bites" and "Casual Dining" dominate the listings.
- **Customer Engagement**: Certain restaurants show much higher votes, suggesting popularity.
- **Pricing Trends**: Some restaurant categories are generally more expensive than others.
